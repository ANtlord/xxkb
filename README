The xxkb program is a keyboard layout switcher and indicator.
Unlike the programs that reloads keyboard maps uand use own shortcats xxkb
is a simple GUI for XKB (X KeyBoard extension) and just sends commands to and
accepts events from XKB.

Additional features are:
* xxkb remebers the current layout in each application and switches it at
  the focus change
* xxkb can put own icon on an application window titlebar, such icon is
  a 'local' layout switcher and indicator for that application
* if a complete keymap has more than two layouts xxkb allows to designate two
  of them as main and alternative ones and switch between them only.
  The alternative layout can be set separately for each application and can
  be changed at runtime.
* xxkb supports lists of application for which some special actions are needed:
  ignore window (for which the keeping of the current layout is unwanted),
  set the current layout and the alternative one at the application start.
* xxkb can be a docked application in WindowMaker, Gnome, KDE and some other
  window manages.
